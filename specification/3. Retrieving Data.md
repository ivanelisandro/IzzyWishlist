# Retrieving Data

## Objectives
- Discover how to make http requests like web browsers do, but using python;
- Retrieve the HTML page for each game in a list;
- Find the relevant information inside the HTML page;
- Transform that information into objects we can use later;


## Steps
Let's try proposing some tasks for achieving these goals. This is item 3, so we will number tasks as 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and so on.

[DONE] 3.1 Using Python, create requests like web browsers:

- The request must be made using a link, like it would in a web browser;
- We must be able to receive a response for such request;
- The response must be an HTML document, and we must be able to store it as some type of object that we can then look for HTML tags inside;
- For now, we can try printing (in the cmd output) the HTML as a string to check that we have the information we require;
- An equivalent, correct response can be acquired by using Insomnia, as shown in the figure "example_1.png". We should aim at retrieving a similar response;
- We must be able to make requests for each member of a list of games (a list of games at this point is equivalent to a list of links to their web-pages);
- This will be enough for this first task, and it will cover the first two objectives;


[DONE] 3.2 Find relevant information

- Inside the game HTML, we have to look for tags script;
- They will have some information we cannot pre-determine, but we know they will have the type application/json;
- It will be something like: < script id="some-crazy-id-will-be-here" type="application/json" >
- All tags of this type will have some JSON data structures, but in one of them we will find the information that is relevant to us;
- We will need to understand this information in order to know how to look for it;
- We need to retrieve from inside these structures' information like: base price, discounted price, content name (any other ideas?);
- For this task, we should try only to find and print the information we want to use (in the cmd output). Each information should be printed in a new line;
- This will be enough for this task, and it will cover the third objective;

[DONE] 3.3 Transform the information into objects

- Use the information retrieved in the previous tasks to create relevant data structures;
- Also, during this task, let's try to structure any previously created code into relevant classes;
- We should have at least three classes:
  - A Browser class that makes requests/retrieves the raw data;
  - A Parser class that takes the Raw data and transforms it into the data we can use;
  - A GameInfo class that stores the parsed information of each game;
- This will be enough for this task, and it will cover the fourth objective, finishing this part of the project;
