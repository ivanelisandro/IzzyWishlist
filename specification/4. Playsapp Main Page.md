# Playsapp Main Page

## Objectives
- The main page must be the wishlist itself;
- Initially, it will load the links from a json file;
- The page should always show a refreshed list when reloaded;
- The information previously gathered about retrieving data must be structured to provide the required information for this page;
- Each item must show the following information:
  - Number;
  - Name;
  - Platform (if possible);
  - Regular price;
  - Discounted price;
  - Discount percentage (if possible);
- In a second step, this page must also have a form for including new links/items in the wishlist;


## Steps
Let's try proposing some tasks for achieving these goals. This is item 4, so we will number tasks as 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, and so on.

[DONE] 4.1 Using Python and Django, create the basic structure of the wishlist:

- Reload the list from the JSON file whenever the page is opened/reloaded;
- Replace the content block of the Django template with a list template, in the templates/playsapp/index.html file;
- At this point, we should keep the list simple, with the following information:
  - Number;
  - Name;
  - Regular price;
  - Discounted price;
  - Discount percentage;
  - Link to store;
- We should experiment a little with the layout here, try to find out what feels nice;
- Styles should be defined in the base.css file;


[DONE] 4.2 Add a form to include new items

- The form should come below the list of items;
- The form should contain:
  - A label;
  - An input text field;
  - A button to submit;
- It should include one link at a time;
- We should probably validate whether it is a valid link before including it in the list;
- When submitting a valid item, we should redirect to the wishlist page itself, which should then show the updated list;

4.3 Improve information shown in the list

- Include new information if possible:
  - Platform;
- Experiment a little more with the layout;
- Define how the list will be ordered: Added date? A-Z order? Optional?
