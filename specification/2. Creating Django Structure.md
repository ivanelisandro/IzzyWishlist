# Creating Django Structure

## Objectives
- Create the basic Django Project;
- Create a Django App for the PS wishlist;
- Update some default configuration of Django project;
- Retrieve some pre-configured basic files used in previous Django projects to simplify initial implementation in this project;

## Steps
There is nothig really complicated in this part.
The goals are pretty much achieved with a few Django commands, reusable files and some pre-defined configurations I have notes for.
